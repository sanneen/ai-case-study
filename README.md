# DBS BANK: GOING ALL IN AI

## Overview
DBS Bank, headquartered in Singapore, has been at the forefront of AI-powered digital transformation.
DBS Bank Limited is a Singaporean multinational banking and financial services corporation headquartered at the Marina Bay Financial Centre in the Marina Bay district of Singapore. The bank was previously known as The Development Bank of Singapore Limited, which "DBS" was derived from, before the present abbreviated name was adopted on 21 July 2003 to reflect its role as a global bank. It is one of the "Big Three" local banks in Singapore, along with Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation (OCBC) and United Overseas Bank (UOB).
DBS is the largest bank in Southeast Asia by assets and among the largest banks in Asia, with assets totaling S$739 billion as of 31 December 2023. It also holds market-dominant positions in consumer banking, treasury and markets, securities brokerage, equity and debt fund-raising in other regions aside from Singapore, including in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Indonesia.
According to Asian Private Banker magazine in 2023, DBS replaced Credit Suisse as the third-largest private bank in Asia, excluding onshore China, with approximately US$201 billion (S$271 billion) assets under management.

## Business Activities
In 2009, DBS had the lowest customer satisfaction scores of any bank in Singapore. Today, it’s been recognized as the world’s best digital bank multiple years over — thanks in large part to its deliberate digital transformation journey that relies on artificial intelligence. 
DBS has successfully used machine learning models in its business operations by making significant investments in data platforms, analytical capabilities, talent acquisition, and upscaling an innovative culture. 
The “All in on AI” strategy has yielded concrete outcomes for DBS in terms of expansion, productivity, and enhanced customer satisfaction. Once a laggard in customer satisfaction surveys among banks in Singapore, DBS has become the world’s best digital bank fueled by AI. 

How has AI-driven and shaped this strategic turnaround? Some key points about DBS engagement with AI include:
- Early Digital Transformation Journey: DBS embarked on its digital transformation journey in 2014, well ahead of its peers. By repurposing its technology stack to run on cloud and open source, leveraging APIs and microservices, and growing its in-house tech capabilities, DBS laid the foundations to become an AI-fueled bank
- AI/ML Models and Use Cases: DBS has developed over 600 AI/ML models and 300 use cases. These investments in AI have already delivered economic value, including revenue uplift and cost avoidance, totaling SGD 180 million in 2022
- In-House Solutions: DBS uses two in-house designed solutions:
- ADA (Advancing DBS with AI): An internal self-service platform that ensures data governance, discoverability, quality, and security.
- ALAN: An award-winning AI protocol and knowledge repository that enables rapid deployment of AI at scale and speed
- Hyper-Personalization: DBS leverages AI to send out 45 million hyper-personalized nudges monthly to over five million customers across the region. Additionally, it uses AI/ML and data analytics to pre-emptively alert small and medium enterprise (SME) customers of credit risks and identify SME customers in need of financing
